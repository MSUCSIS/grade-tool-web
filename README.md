# Grading Tool Web Application

This is the web application portion of an internal (currently) grading tool
some of the courses taught by the CSIS faculty at 
[Murray State University](http://www.murraystate.edu/academics/CollegesDepartments/CollegeOfBusiness/Programs/CSIS/).

Ultimately, the goal is to allow students to have their assignments checked against a provided, yet hidden, test suite
and provide them with feedback about problems that are found with their code.
